# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.
I am using this to learn different programming languages as I go along the list of puzzles. Each individual solution is in its own folder, and the README.md file in each folder contains the puzzle description and my solution. Each solution is written in multiple languages, and the README.md file contains a list of the languages used. The solutions are not necessarily the most efficient, but they are the first solutions that I came up with.

For each AoC run, I have a different branch for each language I have used. The main branch, where I will merge once I am done with all the puzzles for the year, will contain the solutions in all the languages I have used.

The structure of the repository is as follows:

- `README.md`: This file.
- Additional files for housekeeping, such as `.gitignore` and `LICENSE`.
- `[year]` for each year of AoC
  - `[day]` for each day of the year
    - `[language]` for each language used
      - `README.md`: The puzzle description and my solution.
      - `solution.[extension]`: The solution file.

## Languages used

I will be using the following languages in decreasing order of experience:
